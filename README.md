# ATMEGA32_Drivers
ATMEGA32 is an AVR based Î¼Controller. 
I wrote some of its peripheral drivers based on classic Software Architicuter: 
  * List MCAL
  * List HAL
  * List Service Layer
  * List Application Layer
Each driver has its branch in the repository.
I wold be happy if you contripute with me to build this library.
