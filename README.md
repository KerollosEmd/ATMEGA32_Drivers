# ATMEGA32_Drivers
ATMEGA32 is an AVR based Î¼Controller. 

I wrote some of its peripheral drivers based on classic Software Architicuter: 
  *  MCAL
  *  HAL
  *  Service Layer
  *  Application Layer


 Each driver has its branch in the repository.
 
 I wold be happy if you contripute with me to build this library.
